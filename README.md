# FeedReader Testing

Project 5 of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to learn how to use [Jasmine framework](https://jasmine.github.io/) to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

The required tests for the project are provided in comments in the `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` file.

You can find the Udacity starter code [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

## To Get Started

* Clone or download the project on your machine.
* Open the `index.html` file with a browser of your choice.
* The Jasmine test suites are displayed at the bottom of the webpage. The green color indicates a passing test, whereas red indicates a failing test.
